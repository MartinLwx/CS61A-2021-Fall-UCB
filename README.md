## Hi üëã

This is my personal learning record for CS61A-Fall-2021 of UC-Berkeley. I once heard that it's an amazing cs course and it's very helpful for those who are new to programming, so I decided to take this course to see if I could learn something new.



To be honest, this is the best introductory computer programming class I've ever taken. Even for me, a CS student, some of the problems are still challenging. How I wish I could take a class like this when I was an undergraduate

## Highlights

-   High order functions üëç
-   Recursion üëç *I really like this one*
-   Scheme language üëç *This is brand new knowledge for me*
-   BNF üëç
-   Abstraction üëç *The most import concept in CS in my opinion.*
